Montey Hall Simulation - Simple

"One of the most famous television game shows from the heyday of the genre from the 1950s to the 1980s was Let’s Make a Deal. Its host, Monty Hall, achieved a second kind of fame when a dilemma in probability theory, loosely based on the show, was named after him. A contestant is faced with three doors. Behind one of them is a sleek new car. Behind the other two are goats. The contestant picks a door, say Door 1. To build suspense, Monty opens one of the other two doors, say Door 3, revealing a goat. To build the suspense still further, he gives the contestant an opportunity either to stick with their original choice or to switch to the unopened door. You are the contestant. What should you do?


Almost everyone stays. They figure that since the car was placed behind one of the three doors at random, and Door 3 has been eliminated, there is now a fifty‑fifty chance each that the car will be behind Door 1 or Door 2. Though there’s no harm in switching, they think, there’s no benefit either. So they stick with their first choice out of inertia, pride, or anticipation that their regret after an unlucky switch would be more intense than their delight after a lucky one."

Lets test that theory with a simulation. One of these two scripts tests the observed probability in the first case and appears to have equal output to the reshuffle, leading me to believe that the difference is infact behavioral, in that the person selecting the door knows the solution.

1. Do you think that reshuffling your door selection makes any difference?
2. Does this difference exist in real life? Does it exist a' prior? Should it exist in simulations?
